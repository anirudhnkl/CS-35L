I started by setting up the BeagleBone as stated in the Piazza. I had to install a new OS of Debian to reset it. And then I enable wifi and x11,
ssh-ed from my computer, and installed all the necessities including firefox. Then, I worked with my partner, Karthik Pullela to SSH into his BeagleBone.

We checked if we had openssh with the following command.
    dpkg --get-selections	|	grep openssh 

Then, I generated public and private keys, created an account for Karthik with a directory, and then updated ownership and permission of the .ssh directory with the following commands, 
run through a SSH session from my computer to the BeagleBone. Now, Karthik has a directory to SSH into securely.

    ssh-keygen

    cd /home
    mkdir ani
    sudo useradd -d /home/ani -m anis
    sudo passwd ani

    cd /home/ani
    sudo mkdir .ssh

    sudo chown -R ani .ssh
    sudo chmod 700 .ssh

Then on Karthik's BeagleBone, he generated the public and private keys and copied them to my BeagleBone for authetication. Then,  he added the private key to the ssh-agent
too allow for connection.

    ssh-keygen

    ssh-copy-id -i ani@192.168.1.5
    ssh-add

Now, we are ready for him to SSH into my BeagleBone. He can access the directory and create files, which I can see through the terminal on my computer.

    ssh ani@192.168.1.5
    echo "hello" > hi.txt

    ssh -X ani@192.168.1.5
    firefox

Now, he can securely connect to my BeagleBone.
