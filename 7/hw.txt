1. The resulting network is still secure because the data sent are encrypted
with the private key and the server's public key so the other teams have no 
way to decrypt it. 

(1) The network is still secure because even if other teams tapped out keyboards
and found out the passphrase, the generated private key will be different, thus
not allowing them to access the data.

(2) The network might still be secure. They can access the system files located on
the USB and gain access to the keys, which can be used to access the server.
But this is only true if the system files are located are located on the drive.
We can also secure the private key with a password to avoid this risk.

2. The gpg2 --verify command does not really verify that I personally created the 
file in question because it only checks to see if the file and the detached signatures
match or not. It does not check if I created the file. To solve this problem, we can
use a third party certifier to check and make sure we have the correct public key.
