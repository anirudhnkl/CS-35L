1.

I downloaded the Coreutils 8.29 source code, its signature, and its GNU keyring and moved it to a directory, using the wget command. In the directory, there are 3 files now: coreutils-8.29.tar.xz, coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig, and gnu-keyring.gpg. 

Now, I can verify the signature of Coreutils source code by running the following command: gpg --verify --keyring ./gnu-keyring.gpg coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig. The verification returns a warning that the key is not certified with a trusted signature. This means that they key I signed with is notary own key, but it does not speak to the safety of the packet so it is not a worry.

2.

I unzipped the package with tar -xvf coreutils-8.29.tar.xz , without the -z because the file is a .xz not a .gz. I configured the make file to ensure that it installs in a directory that I made, coreutilsIntsall using the following command: ./configure --prefix=/u/cs/ugrad/balasubr/cs35l/3/inst. Then, I compiled it with the make command and installed it with the make install command.

3.

To reproduce the bug, I made a shell script la with the same code as the one on the assignment, but I used ./ls instead of ls so the ls in the coreutils is used. Then I ran it with ./la -A.

4.

I applied the patch by creating a patch_file and applying it. I cd into coreutils-8.29 directory and then pasted contents of the patch file into a new file created with the emacs patch_file command. And then I ran patch -p1 < patch_file to apply the patch. Then I recompiled it with the make command.

5.

GEN command is run many times and it is used to create documentation for the given files.
CC and LD command is also run and these commands are used to compile and link ls and its dependencies, relatively.

6.

Now, I tested the modified and installed ls command to see if the patch fixed the bug. I tested the commands on a file that I just made and on a file that is one year old. The modified ls is in the directory /u/cs/ugrad/balasubr/cs35l/3/inst and the installed ls command is in another directory /u/cs/ugrad/balasubr/cs35l/3/new. I had the la script file as described in the assignment.
