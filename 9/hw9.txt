I checked out the version 3.0 of Diffutils into a new branch called quote. Then, I patched it with quote-3.0-patch.txt successfully.
    git checkout v3.0 -b quote
    patch p-1 < quote-3.0-patch.txt

Then, I learned how to use the Emacs function add-change-log-entry-other-window and updated the ChangeLog to include all the changes that
were made for the six files. Next, I commited the patch with the updated ChangeLog as they commit message.
    
    git commit -aF ChangeLog

Then, I generated a patch called formatted-patch.txt 
    git format-patch -1 --stdout > formatted-patch.txt

My partner was Tanish Ambulkar. I renamed the patch he sent me to tan-formatted-patch.txt.
I switched to a new branched called partner and applied Tanish's patch and then rebuilt the system.

    git checkout v3.0 -b partner
    git am tan-formatted-patch.txt
    ./bootstrap
    ./configure
    make
    make check

Then, I ran make distdir and then viewed the ChangeLog in diffutils-3.0.1-cd92 to confirm that it works.
    make distdir
    cd diffutils-3.0.1-cd92
    cat ChangeLog

            maint: quote 'like this' or "like this", not `like this'

            This is in response to a recent change in the GNU coding standards,
            which now suggest quoting 'like this' or "like this", instead of
            `like this' or ``like this''.

    Finally, I moved to the master branch of emacs and ran gitk on it. I had to make sure I ssh with -Y applied.
    I ran gitk and found the newest merge that is not newer than 2015-01-25.

        cd ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs
        gitk
